## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #E6B800 (RGB). A saturated, warm yellow that evokes the color of desert sand at sunset. Morocco's arid, sun-drenched landscape evokes the country's essence, which is why a sand-like primary is chosen.
- Background color: #26231A (RGB). A very dark, desaturated hue of the primary color, appropriate for a dark color scheme.
- Accent color: #E65C00 (RGB). A vivid analogous color to the primary, offering a balance of heat and contrast.
- Clean and modern font for titles.
- Readable and simple font for body text.
- Clear grid layout for car rental listings to ensure easy browsing.
